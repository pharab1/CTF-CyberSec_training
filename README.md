# CTF-CyberSec_training
Welcome to my walkthrough of a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge conducted in a simulated environment. The objective: **find 8 hidden flags by exploiting common system and network vulnerabilities**.

---

## Scenario

Youâ€™re placed in a virtual environment simulating real-world vulnerabilities. Your objective: find 8 flags hidden in different parts of the network through scanning, exploitation, password cracking, and traffic analysis.

## Flags Overview

| Flag | Description                                                      | Technique Used                        |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Found in image metadata                                          | `exiftool`                             |
| 2 | Hidden in `robots.txt`                                           | `nikto` scan + URL discovery           |
| 3 | Inside a zip file cracked with `fcrackzip`                       | Wordlist attack using `rockyou.txt`    |
| 4 | Embedded in a messy script file                                  | Directory traversal                    |
| 5 | Retrieved from a secret directory                                | `curl`, `cat`                          |
| 6 | Extracted from a `.pcap` file using IP as password               | Wireshark + zip cracking               |
| 7 | Accessed via SSH-like login using flags 5 & 6                    | Credential reuse                       |
| 8 | Discovered through privilege escalation in system directories    | Python script execution                |
